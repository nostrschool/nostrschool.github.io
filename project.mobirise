This includes understanding its principles, applications in decentralised networks, and implications for digital citizenship.\n<br>\n<br>Staff and Students Use the Protocol: Nostr School integrates the use of the Nostr protocol into daily activities, fostering a practical understanding of decentralised technologies and promoting digital literacy among staff and students.\n<br>\n<br>Digital Portfolios on Nostr: Each student maintains a digital portfolio on the Nostr platform, showcasing their academic achievements, projects, and personal growth over time. This portfolio serves as a comprehensive record of their educational journey and development.\n<br>\n<br>Students Learning About Data Ownership: As part of digital literacy education, students at Nostr School learn about data ownership, privacy rights, and ethical considerations in digital interactions. This empowers them to navigate the digital landscape responsibly and securely.\n<br>\n<br>Admissions and Governance\n<br>\n<br>Open Enrollment: Nostr School welcomes students from all backgrounds and abilities, promoting inclusivity and diversity within our educational community.\n<br>\n<br>Community Governance: While respecting the principles of decentralised governance, Nostr School maintains transparency through open communication channels with parents and the broader community.\n<br>\n<br>Accountability: Performance metrics are transparently communicated, and the school operates with accountability to both educational standards and community expectations.\n<br>\n<br>Facilities and Support\n<br>\n<br>Nostr School provides state-of-the-art facilities conducive to modern learning environments.
